# DQ R-Project 9: Investigating the Changes in the Fandango Ratings
This is my ninth project in Dataquest towards my journey in R Programming. This project aims to analyze the more recent movie ratings data to determine whether there has been any change in Fandango's rating system after Hickey's analysis. 
In this project, the following concepts are used to achieve the given problem:
- Sampling
- Summary Statistics
- Distribution Plots
